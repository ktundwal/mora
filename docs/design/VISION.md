## Vision Statement

**Mora is your AI thought partner for high-stakes moments in work, relationships, and life.**

We help you pause when triggered, see your blind spots, and respond from your best self—not your defensive self.

---

## The Problem We Solve

People fail high-stakes moments (tense conversation with manager, conflict with partner, big life decision) not because they don't care, but because they lack:

1. **Emotional vocabulary** — Can't name what's happening internally
2. **Pattern awareness** — Don't see they're repeating the same defensive moves
3. **Nervous system regulation** — React too fast, from triggered state
4. **Perspective** — Hear "attack" instead of "pain/need"
5. **Better language** — Default to explaining, defending, negotiating

**Cost of failure:**
- **Relationships:** Trigger → reaction → rupture → silence → resentment → repeat
- **Work:** Poorly worded message erodes trust with manager/peer/report
- **Life:** Big decisions made from fear, regretted later

## Our Solution

### Core Capabilities

**1. Real-Time Intervention**
- Paste tense WhatsApp/Slack conversation → Instant "Unpack" analysis
- See what they're really saying (pain/need vs attack)
- Get reply draft options that won't make it worse

**2. Pattern Recognition** (Powered by MIRA-OSS)
- AI learns YOUR specific defensive patterns over time
- "You're about to over-explain again" (your tell)
- "Last 3 times you felt this way about Sarah, here's what actually happened"

**3. Decision Support**
- Journal about big decisions ("Should I quit?")
- AI surfaces relevant memories, past outcomes, your values
- See your decision-making patterns over time

**4. Self-Model Building** (MIRA Domaindocs)
- Persistent playbooks: "What works when talking to Manager about deadlines"
- Collaborative knowledge: You and AI co-create strategies
- Doesn't decay—permanent wisdom blocks

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Low Usage Frequency
**Symptom:** Users only return during crises (monthly)

**Mitigation:**
- Daily "Reflect" prompt (habit nudge)
- Pattern dashboard (shows progress)
- Streak counter (gamification)

### Risk 2: AI Quality Issues
**Symptom:** Unpacks are generic, users don't trust

**Mitigation:**
- Use Claude Opus 4.5 (best model)
- Iterate prompts based on user feedback
- Show confidence scores

### Risk 3: Warm Paradox
**Symptom:** AI-written replies feel insincere

**Mitigation:**
- Emphasize co-authoring ("Start here, add your touch")
- Show multiple tones
- Flag therapy-speak

### Risk 4: Privacy Concerns
**Symptom:** Users afraid to share sensitive content

**Mitigation:**
- E2E encryption (visible in marketing)
- No server-side decryption
- Recovery phrase (user owns data)

### Risk 5: Competitive Response
**Symptom:** MosaicChats adds memory system

**Mitigation:**
- Ship fast (first-mover advantage)
- E2E encryption as moat (hard to copy)
- Therapist partnerships (distribution advantage)

---

## Why We'll Win

1. **Real pain point:** High-stakes moments are universal, costly, recurring
2. **Technical moat:** MIRA memory engine takes 6-12 months to replicate
3. **Privacy advantage:** E2E encryption differentiates from all competitors
4. **Broad positioning:** Work + life = multiple paths to PMF
5. **No rush advantage:** Time to obsess over UX quality, build trust, compound content

**The long game:** In 18 months, we'll have 5,000 users who love us, $50k MRR with healthy unit economics, and clear path to $1M ARR via enterprise.

## Open Questions

1. **Encryption UX:** Delay setup until second session to reduce friction?
2. **MIRA Integration:** Decrypt in Cloud Function or skip encryption for journal entries?
3. **Pricing:** Test $9/mo (impulse) vs $12/mo (current) vs $15/mo (premium)?
4. **B2B Timing:** When to pilot enterprise (Month 12 or Month 18)?
5. **Platform:** PWA for mobile or build native apps later?
