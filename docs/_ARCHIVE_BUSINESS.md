## Mora — Navigate the moments that shape relationships

Have you been in situations where you’re trying to set a boundary, apologize without defending, ask for what you need, or express appreciation—especially when emotions are high?

Have you felt nervous, reactive, and stuck between saying nothing and saying something you regret?

Hope you had access to always-on support that makes vulnerability safer—without needing appointments with trusted advisors and without fear of repercussions.

Mora is real-time support for relationship-critical moments: it helps you slow down, name what matters, and write words that deepen trust.

Mora solves a high-value problem: helping high-functioning individuals navigate high-stakes 1:1 relationships (work and life) in moments that matter. 

To build a sustainable business, we offer a **value-based monetization model**. 

## Who this is for
- Primary: high-functioning, anxious-leaning individuals who want to show care without spiraling, defensiveness, or therapy-speak.
- Secondary: trusted advisors (therapists/coaches first; later mentors) who want a clearer, structured view of what happened and what to do next.

## Success looks like
- A user can go from pasted thread → clarity + a sendable draft in under 2 minutes.
- A user can retrieve any past high-stakes moment in under 10 seconds.
- Free → Pro conversion exceeds 5%.

## Hard questions

### What
Mora is a mobile-first web app that helps people handle high-stakes 1:1 relationships (partner, parent, boss, direct report, mentor) in moments that matter — conflict, repair, comfort, boundaries, and appreciation. Users paste a conversation (e.g., WhatsApp, email excerpt, transcript) and Mora produces two outcomes quickly:

1) **Unpack (understanding):** A structured, emotionally accurate read of what the other person is expressing (pain/need), where escalation happened, and what the user likely did that landed as harmful—without “therapy-speak” or moralizing.  
2) **Reply Draft (repair):** Short, human, on-tone reply options that reduce defensiveness, lower reactivity, and increase the chance of repair.

Mora is designed for the high-functioning, anxious-leaning user who spirals under emotional load, over-explains, and unintentionally harms trust while trying to fix things.

### Why
These moments are a recurring, compounding tax on people’s lives and careers:

- **Life relationships:** trigger → reaction → rupture → silence → resentment → repeat.  
- **Work relationships:** one poorly worded message can degrade trust with a manager, peer, or direct report; performance suffers even when intentions were good.

People don’t fail because they “don’t care.” They fail because in the moment they lack:
- emotional vocabulary (they can’t name what’s happening)
- nervous-system regulation (they react too fast)
- translation skills (they hear “attack” instead of “pain/need”)
- repair language (they default to explaining, defending, or negotiating)

Existing solutions don’t meet the moment:
- **Therapy/coaching** is expensive, periodic, and not available exactly when the text arrives.
- **Generic AI chatbots** are verbose and inconsistent, and often drift into diagnosing or therapy-speak that backfires.
- **Books/courses** are helpful, but too slow to apply under pressure.

Mora is informed by trusted frameworks (e.g., Nonviolent Communication and cognitive-behavioral techniques) while staying practical: it helps users name emotions/needs, reduce defensiveness, and make clear requests. Mora is not a substitute for therapy or clinical care.

### So What
Mora is built around a differentiated promise: move users from **“Fear of Losing”** → **“Fear of Hurting.”**  
That shift changes behavior from reassurance-seeking and defensiveness to care, repair, and choice.

Mora is a workflow product, not a chat product:
1) Paste conversation (fast capture)  
2) Normalize speakers/timestamps (clarity)  
3) Generate Unpack (witness pause + meaning)  
4) Draft reply variants (action)

This creates immediate ROI: fewer blow-ups, faster repair, fewer days lost to rumination, and better outcomes in both personal and professional relationships.

This also supports a clear subscription business:
- Free tier delivers crisis management.
- Pro tier delivers relationship mastery (higher frequency, deeper history, richer insights, trusted advisor sharing).

### Why Now
Three forces make Mora “now,” not “someday”:

1) LLMs are finally good enough at nuanced tone and emotional translation when constrained by the right workflow and guardrails. The raw model is not the product; the product is the constraint system.  
2) Relationships are increasingly text-mediated (Slack, WhatsApp, iMessage). The “moment of failure” is often a written message—perfectly suited to capture → analyze → draft.  
3) Therapy is mainstream, but access is constrained. People want help, but sessions are expensive and not real-time. Mora fills the gap: in-the-moment support, not weekly reflection.

## The Business Model: Freemium + B2B2C
We will adopt a two-pronged approach:
1.  **Consumer Subscription (Mora Pro):** $15/month or $120/year.
2.  **Trusted Advisor Partner Program (B2B2C):** Therapists/coaches first; later expand to mentors. Advisors pay for a dashboard to view client-shared reports, or clients pay to unlock sharing with their advisor.

## Market landscape (why this can be big)
- The “vocabulary gap” is most acute where relationships now live: text threads (WhatsApp/iMessage/DMs) and workplace messaging (Slack/Teams/email).
- The adjacent spend is large across both consumer mental health and enterprise soft-skills/leadership training; the wedge is moving from content/courses to “embedded intelligence” that shows up inside workflows.

## Competitive positioning (how we win)
The market splits into two common approaches:
- **Analytics/diagnostics:** compatibility scoring, dashboards, personality labeling, “red flags,” and long-horizon pattern mining.
- **Exercises/gamification:** daily prompts, journaling, and relationship “maintenance” loops.

Mora’s bet is different: **real-time interpersonal intervention**.
- We optimize for the moment that matters (replying, repairing, comforting, setting boundaries), not a relationship report card.
- We are intentionally anti-"diagnosis": no personality tests, no compatibility score, no clinical labels. We translate to emotions/needs and produce a safer next message.
- We keep outputs practical and non-performative (anti therapy-speak, “no-shield” guardrails).
- We keep privacy and data-minimization as a product advantage, not a footnote.

## Key risks (and how we design around them)
- **Warmth dampener (AI sincerity risk):** If a message feels “AI-written,” it can land as less sincere.
	- Mitigation: Mora is a co-author, not an auto-sender. Drafts are short, editable, and tuned to the user’s voice. We nudge users to add one true, specific human detail.
- **Brittle social reasoning:** LLMs can be wrong under small context shifts.
	- Mitigation: structured outputs + explicit assumptions + user review; avoid “verdicts” and instead offer options, questions, and careful language.
- **Privacy sensitivity:** Raw threads are emotionally and professionally sensitive.
	- Mitigation: strict data minimization (no raw content in logs), optional redaction mode, and clear user control over what gets shared with trusted advisors.
