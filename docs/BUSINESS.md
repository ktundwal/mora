# Mora CEO Strategy: Path to Revenue
Date: Dec 18, 2025

## Executive Summary
Mora solves a high-value problem: relationship conflict for high-functioning individuals. Currently, the product is designed as a utility. To build a sustainable business, we must pivot to a **value-based monetization model** immediately. We cannot rely on "optional later" monetization.

## 1. The Business Model: Freemium + B2B2C
We will adopt a two-pronged approach:
1.  **Consumer Subscription (Mora Pro):** $15/month or $120/year.
2.  **Therapist Partner Program (B2B):** Therapists pay for a dashboard to view client data, or clients pay to "unlock" sharing with their therapist.

### The "Mora Pro" Value Proposition
The Free tier is for **Crisis Management** (occasional use).
The Pro tier is for **Relationship Mastery** (daily/weekly use).

| Feature | Free | Pro ($15/mo) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Unpacks** | 3 per month | Unlimited |
| **Reply Drafting** | Basic (1 tone) | Advanced (3 tones + Custom) |
| **History** | Last 7 days | Full History + Search |
| **Insights** | None | "Conflict Trends" & "Trigger Map" |
| **Therapist Share** | No | Yes (PDF Export + Link) |
| **Playbook** | 5 entries | Unlimited + Expert Templates |

## 2. Strategic Enhancements to Roadmap

### Phase 1: The Payment Infrastructure (Immediate)
*   **Stripe Integration:** We need to accept payments in v1. Do not launch without a "Upgrade to Pro" button, even if it's just a waitlist or a simple payment link initially.
*   **Paywall Logic:** Implement hard limits on the free tier (e.g., "You have 1 Unpack left this month").

### Phase 2: The "Therapist Loop" (High Leverage)
*   **Therapist Export:** A one-click "Prepare for Session" report. This is our viral loop. Users bring this to therapy -> Therapist sees Mora -> Therapist recommends Mora to other clients.
*   **Feature:** "Therapist Mode" toggle that hides the "Draft Reply" (acting) and focuses purely on "Unpack" (understanding), as some therapists may object to AI writing texts.

### Phase 3: Retention via "Peace Time" Features
*   **Daily Check-in:** A simple 1-minute "How are we doing?" prompt to log sentiment when *not* fighting.
*   **Appreciation Log:** Force users to log positive things, not just negative. This balances the data and the relationship.

## 3. Required Documentation Changes
1.  **PRD:** Add "Monetization" as a core pillar. Define the Free/Pro split.
2.  **Dev Plan:** Add "Epic E: Payments & Subscriptions".
3.  **Architecture:** Ensure user data can be segmented by subscription status.

## 4. Marketing Angle
*   **Positioning:** "Cheaper than one session of therapy. More effective than a week of silence."
*   **Target:** The "Anxious-Preoccupied" partner in a relationship with an "Avoidant" partner. They feel the most pain and are most willing to pay for a solution.

## 5. Acquisition Channels (Priority Order)
1.  **Therapist Referrals:** Build therapist outreach list. One therapist = 10-50 potential users.
2.  **Reddit/TikTok Content:** "What my anxious attachment taught me" content. Link in bio.
3.  **SEO Long-tail:** "how to respond when partner is upset" type queries.
4.  **ProductHunt Launch:** Day 1 visibility spike.

## 6. Anti-Goals (Do NOT Build)
- Daily check-ins, journaling, appreciation logs (retention theater before we have users)
- Multi-user workspaces (complexity before PMF)
- Video transcription (nice-to-have, not revenue-critical)
